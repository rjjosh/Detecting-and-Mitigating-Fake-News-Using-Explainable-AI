# Detecting-and-Mitigating-Fake-News-Using-Explainable-AI

This project is about opening the black box of fake news detection using explainable AI. This enables the journalists, policy makers and social platforms why a particular piece of information was classified as fake or real (Wang, 2017).  This makes the whole system transparent and more trustworthy. Instead of just looking at the words in the news story, this approach says we have to look at how the human brain works too. It makes the system smarter because it factors in who said it (authority/trust) and who's listening (political bias). By doing this, we get a much better picture of why a piece of misinformation actually takes off, which is the first step to shutting it down.

Description of the TSV format:

Column 6: the speaker's job title.
Column 7: the state info.
Column 8: the party affiliation.
Column 9-13: the total credit history count, including the current statement.

11: half true counts.
12: mostly true counts.
